# Where to lay this dataset ?

`cifar-10-batches-py` is the dataset that you use in all assignments. You can put this dataset under the directory of `\assignmentx_jupyter\assignmentx\cs231n\datasets\`. In another way, you can also use `get_datasets.sh` to download, however this way maybe have some problems.
