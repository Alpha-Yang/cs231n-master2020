# cs231n-master2020
The finished assignment of cs231n in Stanford University 2020.

Cs231n has three assignments in 2020. I prefer jupyterbook to finish them.



### cifar-10-batches-py

This is the dataset which we need to finish our homework, and you can download from my github. Of course, you can use `sh` to download, just following the steps of [cs231n](cs231n.github.io) website which is very concrete and easy. By the way, I recommend that all your packages you need in these assignments should be downloaded in the active environment. 



### assignment1_jupyter

The first assignment is not very easy, just be careful about `future` package. The `requirements.txt` has the improper version of `future` package. You need to download a new version in active environment by following the next command.

``` python
pip install future
```

I think this is the only problem, while other problems on website I didn't face.
